# Library Management System

This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* in Python by simulating a simple Library Management System. The system allows for managing books in a library, borrowing and returning books, and handling operations via a librarian.

## Introduction

The *Library Management System* is a Python-based project built to showcase OOP concepts like *classes, **objects, **methods, and **encapsulation*. The system manages books, their availability, borrowing, and returning operations through interaction with the library and its members.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python and OOP principles and helps in understanding how to design a small, functional application.

## Features

- *Add books* to the library collection.
- *View available books* in the library.
- *Borrow and return books* by members.
- *Librarian functionality* to manage books and member activities.
  
## Technologies Used

- *Python 3.x*: The programming language used for the entire project.
  
This project is implemented using core Python without any external libraries, which makes it easy for beginners to run and understand.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Download the project files by cloning this repository using the following command:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management.git


### 2. Navigate to Project Directory
Go into the project directory:
bash
cd library-management


### 3. Run the Application
You can run the project by executing the main Python script. No additional installation is required since the project does not depend on external libraries:
bash
python library.py


## Usage Guide

Once the project is running, you can interact with the system as follows:

1. *Adding Books*: A librarian can add new books to the library’s collection.
2. *Viewing Available Books*: The system displays a list of all the books available for borrowing.
3. *Borrowing a Book*: Members can borrow a book if it is available.
4. *Returning a Book*: Once the member is done with the book, they can return it to the library.
5. *Library Management*: The librarian manages the operations, ensuring books are properly recorded in the system.

## Class Structure

### 1. *Book Class*
   - This class represents individual books in the library. Each book has attributes like title, author, and its availability status.
   
   - *Key Responsibilities*:
     - Tracks whether the book is currently available for borrowing.
     - Provides methods for borrowing and returning the book.

### 2. *Library Class*
   - The *Library* class holds a collection of books and manages all book-related operations.
   
   - *Key Responsibilities*:
     - Stores the books that are available in the library.
     - Provides methods to add new books to the collection.
     - Allows members to borrow and return books.

### 3. *Librarian Class*
   - The *Librarian* class acts as the manager of the library. The librarian can manage book operations and track which books are borrowed or returned by members.
   
   - *Key Responsibilities*:
     - Adds books to the library.
     - Facilitates viewing of available books.
     - Manages book borrowing and returning processes.

### Workflow Summary

1. A *librarian* adds books to the library’s collection.
2. The system checks whether a book is available when a *member* requests to borrow it.
3. After borrowing, the book's status is updated to "unavailable."
4. When a book is returned, its status is reset, making it available for borrowing again.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some possible improvements that can be made to the project:

- *Member Management*: Implement a Member class to keep track of multiple members and their borrowing history.
- *Reservation System*: Allow members to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
- *Late Fees Calculation*: Add a feature to calculate and charge late fees for overdue book returns.
- *User Interface*: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter for ease of use.
- *Database Integration*: Store book and member data in a database for persistence.
